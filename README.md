# ziontechhub_hackathon_submission
Official submission for the ZionTechub Hackathon 2025 (Data Science Category). A 3-week challenge to solve real-world problems using data-driven insights, analytics, and machine learning. Submission deadline: May 6th, 2025.

# Loan Risk Assessment Model

Absolutely! Below is a **step-by-step template** for writing a **professional GitHub README for a Data Science project**. This is widely used by data scientists to showcase notebooks, results, and insights effectively.

### 1. **Loan Risk Assessment Model**

```markdown
# 📊 Customer Loan Risk Assessment
Predicting whether loan applicants are risky using machine learning and real-world data.
```

---

### 2. **Project Introduction**

```markdown
## 📌 Introduction

This project aims to assess the **credit risk of loan applicants** by building predictive machine learning models. The goal is to determine whether a loan applicant is "risky" or "not risky" based on demographic and financial features such as income, job history, home ownership, and location.
```

---

### 3. **Business or Research Objective**

```markdown
## 🎯 Objective

- Build a classification model to **predict loan risk**.
- Understand **key factors** that influence applicant risk.
- Help financial institutions make better **credit decisions**.
```

---

### 4. **Dataset Overview**

```markdown
## 🧠 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on loan applicants. Here are the key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Income` | Applicant's income |
| `Age` | Age in years |
| `Experience` | Work experience in years |
| `Married/Single` | Marital status |
| `House_Ownership` | Type of residence |
| `Car_Ownership` | Car ownership status |
| `Profession` | Occupation of the applicant |
| `CITY`, `STATE` | Location information |
| `CURRENT_JOB_YRS` | Years in current job |
| `CURRENT_HOUSE_YRS` | Years in current house |
| `Risk_Flag` | **Target** – 1: Risky, 0: Not Risky |
```

---

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

```markdown
## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Distribution of income, age, and profession
- Relationships between target variable and features
- Visualizations with histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps
```

---

### 6. **Data Preprocessing**

```markdown
## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Missing values handled (if any)
- Encoding of categorical variables using Label/One-Hot encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE
```

---

### 7. **Modeling & Evaluation**

```markdown
## 🤖 Model Training and Evaluation

Models Trained:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes

Metrics Used:
- Accuracy
- ROC AUC Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

📈 **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest (update with your results)
```

---

### 8. **Results**

```markdown
## ✅ Results

| Model | Accuracy | ROC AUC |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.78 | 0.76 |
| Random Forest | 0.85 | 0.84 |
| XGBoost | 0.86 | 0.85 |

*Note: Replace with your actual metrics.*
```

---

### 9. **Conclusion**

```markdown
## 🧾 Conclusion

- Income, age, and profession are strong predictors of loan risk.
- Ensemble models like XGBoost and Random Forest perform best.
- Preprocessing and handling imbalanced data significantly improved accuracy.
```

---

### 10. **Future Work**

```markdown
## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model interpretability using SHAP
- Deploy model as a web app (using Streamlit or Flask)
```

---
